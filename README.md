## Description
Sugar is a personal saltstack engine used to make fleet management of servers
easy for the maintainer.

This engine will primarily be used in conjunction with the sister-project, The Flour app

This project is **not** meant to be commercial. This is solely for making my own life easier.

The Flour app will contain the ability to:

* Provisioning/Deprovisioning of virtual machines

* Provide stats and information about all minions

* Upgrade/maintain different linux servers ( I only use linux and MacOS )

* Common commands, perhaps all possible commands
